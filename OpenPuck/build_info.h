// build_info.h -- firmware build provenance, surfaced in the WebUSB panel so you can confirm EXACTLY which
// build is flashed on a board (the git commit it was built from, and whether that working tree was dirty).
//
// The values come from one of two sources, in priority order:
//   1) -D defines on the compile line, e.g. build.extra_flags += -DOPK_GIT_HASH=\"abc12345\" -DOPK_GIT_DIRTY=1
//   2) a generated git_version.h (written by gen_version.sh before compiling), picked up via __has_include.
// If neither is present (a bare checkout compiled by hand) the values fall back to "unknown" / not-dirty, so
// the build always succeeds -- the panel just shows "unknown" until you generate the header.
